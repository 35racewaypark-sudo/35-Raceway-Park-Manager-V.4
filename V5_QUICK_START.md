## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Payout Management:
- **Filter by class** to see just one division's payouts
- **Search by car number** (type "5" to find all drivers with #5x)
- **Print frequently** - use filtered report for specific classes
- Use individual driver printouts as payout receipts

### Statistics Reports:
- **Look for high "Total Passes"** (green) = competitive drivers moving up
- **Compare avg start vs avg finish** - big gap = improvement needed
- **Use for handicapping** - drivers consistently starting/finishing front may need harder draws
- **Share with drivers** - they love seeing their stats!

### General Best Practices:
- Same browser every week (data stays in that browser)
- Update browser occasionally for best performance
- Export CSVs monthly as backup
- Test new features on practice nights first
